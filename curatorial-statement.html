      <p>The New Media Artspace is pleased to present <em>Pinar Yola&ccedil;an: Body-Image</em>, the first exhibition to bring together studio and documentary image and video works from this acclaimed Turkish artist. <em>Body-Image</em> includes
        carefully posed studio images in which the artist painstakingly paints and adorns the bodies of her subjects, alongside more recent documentary work with Kayap&oacute; (Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre) Indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon,
        among
        the only ethnicities to practice full body painting in everyday life.<a href="#_f1" name="_fn1">[1]</a> Seen side-by-side, these diverse series illuminate one another, yielding fresh insights on Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s work. Together, they
        show how presenting women&rsquo;s bodies as images concerns not merely images as works of art in a painterly tradition, but also images as objects of media that attain currency in circulation. Documenting women deploying their body-images
        as
        a
        means to self-possessed empowerment, <em>Body-Image</em> echoes with this demand to be seen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s &ldquo;body-images&rdquo; are the result of intensive collaborations with marginalized people who may seem unlikely to wield authority over their own representations. However, before ever collaborating with
        Yola&ccedil;an,
        her subjects&mdash;ranging from SSBBW subcultural internet stars to Indigenous groups&mdash;had become sophisticated media users who deploy their body-images toward self-determination. <em>Body-Image</em> makes clear that women are not
        necessarily disempowered or silenced when their bodies become images as the conventional critique of photographic and ethnographic objectification might have it. Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s work shows the opposite dynamic unfolding: produced
        through
        trusting relationships often built over the course of years, her works reveal&mdash;and more recently deploy&mdash;the power of her subjects.<a href="#_f2" name="_fn2">[2]</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Pinar Yola&ccedil;an: Body-Image</em> is a hybrid online and in-person exhibition organized in three parts. Part I incorporates an interactive element inviting viewers into an aspect of Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s process; by manipulating
        crops
        of the images, viewers are encouraged to spend time concentrating on the images and can create their own temporary compositions. Part II also highlights process and duration, this time sharing never-before-published frames from a photoshoot
        that
        documents Kayap&oacute; Chief Tuire painting the body of a young woman in her community; these images show Tuire&rsquo;s evolving process in paint. Part III consists of a film which documents an extended conversation between Tuire and
        Yola&ccedil;an that gives voice to Tuire&rsquo;s concerns and shares her knowledge; here too process and duration are integral, as Yola&ccedil;an intentionally includes time in translation, which more conventional documentarians might edit
        out.
        The exhibition appears online in its entirety, with Part III also on view in-person.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yola&ccedil;an first received widespread recognition for works of portraiture that conceived bodily flesh as a site of slippage between human and nonhuman organisms. In contrast, the body-images in Part I are coolly artifactual and
        seemingly
        inorganic. With these works, Yola&ccedil;an veers headlong into the nonhuman, forsaking even the organicism of flesh. In place of flesh, these works evoke material misrecognition, picturing bodies&mdash;in part or whole&mdash;as iconic,
        powerful,
        even totemic. Among her varied sources of inspiration, Yola&ccedil;an cites a Pre-Neolithic anthropomorphic vessel that borrows the shape of a woman&rsquo;s body,<a href="#_f3" name="_fn3">[3]</a> as well as modern and contemporary painters
        from Jenny Saville and Francis Bacon to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Italian Futurists. Across archaeology and Modernist abstract painting, Part I shows body-images of women mimicking the forms of objects that mimic the forms of women.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Culled from distinct series, Part I&rsquo;s highly stylized photographs are punctuated by short videos all shot in controlled studio settings. In sequence, they travel from mimetic abstraction with bodies retaining a referential quality,
        into
        high abstraction with bodies appearing as pure color and shape. In works from the <em>Mother Goddess</em> series (2009), textured and ornamented bodies recognizably reference ancient objects like vessels and statues celebrating feminine
        powers
        of
        fertility. By comparison, coated in a single vibrant hue of latex, bodies in the series <em>Like a Stone</em> (2011), appear as absolute form, like a singular brush stroke of paint standing out against a contrasting solid ground. These
        graphic
        body-images might be becoming the gestures and materials of painting. Finally, in the <em>Corpo Mechanico </em>(2013&ndash;2014) and <em>Nudes</em> (2012) series, bodies meld with and move against their backgrounds. <em>Corpo Mechanico</em>
        seems
        to recall surrealist Roger Caillois&rsquo;s famous depiction of insects that so successfully camouflage themselves as their leafy surroundings that they cannot discern the difference between their kind and their setting&mdash;resulting in
        cannibalism. For Caillois, such non-adaptive mimicry is &ldquo;a luxury and even a dangerous luxury.&rdquo;<a href="#_f4" name="_fn4">[4]</a> Instead, Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s non-adaptive mimicry incites movement. In <em>Corpo
          Mechanico</em>, movement on the surface of body-images seems to vibrate, burnishing figures to blur into grounds. <em>Nudes</em> takes movement further, capturing a body in ongoing motion as a frozen image.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yola&ccedil;an credits shooting the dynamic images in <em>Nudes</em> in improvisation with her subjects as impetus for her moving image works punctuating Part I. Each short video results from a years-long relationship and rapport
        cultivated
        between Yola&ccedil;an and the individual performers: a Turkish belly dancer, an Indian Kathak dancer, and a Brazilian funk dancer. Across these diverse cultural contexts, Yola&ccedil;an considers changing cultural and historical
        perceptions
        of
        body-images among dance practitioners and in the public eye. Her videos highlight feminine power in these dance forms which all center on the female body.</p>

        <p class="door-caption">II.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Body-images appear &ldquo;in the making&rdquo; in Part II, in images Yola&ccedil;an shot with the Kayap&oacute;. While these images document everyday life, they have something in common with the staged images in Part I: they were made
        possible
        through her subjects&rsquo; willing collaboration. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is no simple matter to visit, much less to photograph, Indigenous communities in Brazil. After much effort and research laying groundwork, Yola&ccedil;an was invited to Mojk&acirc;r&acirc;ko village by Chief Ak&rsquo;jaboro. She would
        be
        allowed to take her photographs, in exchange for agreeing to create media on their behalf. Leveraging her role as a photographer, she could help publicize an urgent political issue&mdash;PEC 215, a bill threatening demarcation of Indigenous
        territories&mdash;in the international press.<a href="#_f5" name="_fn5">[5]</a> Defying the stereotypes of na&iuml;ve, passive objects of ethnographic representation, the Kayap&oacute; community members thoughtfully negotiated the
        circulation of their own images. Such astuteness on the part of remote Amazonian villagers to the function of images in global media contexts might seem surprising; however, Kayap&oacute; people have been active participants in their own
        media
        representations for decades. In the late 1980s, anthropologist Terence Turner (a leading expert on Kayap&oacute; cultures) worked with filmmaker Vincent Carelli to help initiate the first-of-its-kind Kayap&oacute; Video Project.
        Kayap&oacute;
        people have been deploying new media from video to recent Internet and social media campaigns to proactively document, promote, and protect their culture and stories ever since. Of the Kayap&oacute; Video Project, Turner wrote, &ldquo;The
        Kayapo
        goals of self-education and self-representation, to outsiders, required a degree of self-objectification and analysis of their own culture.&rdquo;<a href="#_f6" name="_fn6">[6]</a> Such self-determination through self-objectification aligns
        with the notion of <em>Body-Image</em> and the priorities of this exhibition.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Perhaps it is an overly-simplistic suggestion, but Kayap&oacute; people&rsquo;s deft deployment of their representations in media campaigns might reflect their immersion in another form of media: body painting. As Chief Tuire explains, and
        scholars like Turner elaborate, body paint functions as a communication system, conveying information about the wearer to the community. Different forms of paint are worn at specific times of life and to indicate particular kinships,
        milestones,
        or occasions.<a href="#_f7" name="_fn7">[7]</a> For Turner, Kayap&oacute; body paint&mdash;like fashion&mdash;is a visual communication practice that mediates individual and community. In other words, for a Kayap&oacute; person wearing body
        paint, their body already functions as an image that circulates as communications media. As such, it is a short step to conceiving of one&rsquo;s own body-image as a potent unit of media. Political theorist Jodi Dean asserts that media
        objects
        accrue value and power through their circulation.<a href="#_f8" name="_fn8">[8]</a> So self-possession of one&rsquo;s body-image, and indeed borrowing Turner&rsquo;s term &ldquo;self-objectification&rdquo; as a body-image become necessary
        political weapons when navigating contemporary media culture, as Kayap&oacute; community members do so keenly.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Part II shows images of Chief Tuire, one of the only female chiefs of the Kayap&oacute;, in the traditional process of painting the body of young women from her village. The image sequence emphasizes the development of pattern over time.

        <p class="door-caption">III.</p>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Continuing Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s work with the Kayap&oacute;, Part III consists of an hour-long interview between Chief Tuire and Yola&ccedil;an, conducted in Kayap&oacute; language and Portuguese, with real-time translation by
        Tuire&rsquo;s
        brother, and subtitled with English and Turkish translations by Yola&ccedil;an. This candid film eschews many of the constructs of ethnographic documentary filmmaking. Tuire appears seated in a simple chair in her village, while
        Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s presence behind the camera, the translator&rsquo;s interventions and perhaps omissions in the conversation, and the presence of other activity in the village are all evident in the extended Q&amp;A section that
        concludes
        the film. While Yola&ccedil;an directs the conversation in the second half, Tuire clearly leads the film&rsquo;s first section, boldly voicing her concerns and appealing forcefully to the international community to intervene in the plight
        of
        her
        community in the face of what she condemns as government corruption.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A striking moment in the film comes when Yola&ccedil;an asks Tuire about a famous photograph taken in her youth, before she became a chief. The photograph, taken during a press conference for the Altamira protest meeting between members of
        different Indigenous communities and engineers for the Belo Monte Dam (which would eventually devastate Kayap&oacute; territories),<a href="#_f9" name="_fn9">[9]</a> captures a moment when the young Tuire lunges across a bargaining table,
        holding her machete to a male engineer&rsquo;s face. The image was circulated widely in the press at the time and one has the sense that Tuire might have intuitively masterminded the image at least in part as a savvy media stunt. That is,
        that
        she wielded her machete as she did, knowing that her gesture would be photographed by the assembled press, and knowing that the resulting body-image would travel far and wide in a way that her physical body might not. Yet, in response to
        Yola&ccedil;an&rsquo;s query, Tuire explains a slightly different motivation. She put her machete to this engineer because she wanted him to truly see her. &ldquo;&hellip;I heard all of this and I said &hellip; the day of the Altamira
        meeting
        I
        will look into the engineer&rsquo;s eyes. And he is going to see me.&rdquo;<a href="#_f10" name="_fn10">[10]</a> By making herself into an image, she was also making herself into something more than an image: an outright demand to be seen.
